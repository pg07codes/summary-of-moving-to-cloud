# moving to the cloud [coursera course]

- Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services — servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more — over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you are billed for water or electricity at home.

- Like you dont build your own electricity grid for your home electricity connection, you just pay and buy it. Similarly,
you dont have to buy servers, databases, other hardwares, just rent them, use them, pay as you use. Easy, no maintenance cost, secure(if you use a well-known- cloud provides like AWS,Azure), fast, and efficient.

- When it comes to cloud computing, you do not have to invest in hardware in advance or spend a lot of time managing it. Instead, you can provide the exact type and size of computing resources you need to implement your latest breakthrough idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need almost immediately by paying only for what you use

- companies like IBM, HP, which built many such hardwares and sold (or managed these hardwares) these, are are now being offered on cloud are seeing some recent decline in profits as businesses are using cloud more than having there own infrastructure of these costly hardwares

- So even when you are using Gmail, facebook, twitter , you are actually using cloud services indirectly. How? -> You are accesssing your data(your mails, tweets or your posts) which is stored somewhere on the cloud(eg. facebook's data center).

- Cloud Services types- SaaS, PaaS, IaaS - 
```
- In short, all of them are cloud services(any service that uses internet in some way either to do some computation, fetch some data etc) but with varying level of control . In Saas, you have a software which uses cloud services at the backend but you have no control of it like gmail app, google drive. Both of these are softwares that uses cloud (stores data on web , does computation on cloud) but none of which is controlled by you. You can only control the application layer(front-end)
- PaaS gives you a platform as a service, like windows machine/ linux machine with some storage and then you may install
whatever you like on it. Store whatever you wish . It is like your own PC but on cloud.

- IaaS is the most customizable. You have all the raw materials to build a machine. Select your OS, select how much space you need, how much ram you want, any load balancing you want to do.
